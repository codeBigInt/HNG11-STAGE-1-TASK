            <h1>My Gaols for The Next 2years in Tech</h1>
            <p>
                Although I began my journey in tech as a frontend web developer in 2022, mastering several frontend
                technologies such as React, Next.js, and vanilla JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS, I didn't fully
                realize my true aspirations until I joined the HNG internship last year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ever since, my goals have been reshaped, and currently, I am aiming to land a job that will equip me
                with the necessary skills and qualities to start my own tech company upon graduating from university
                next year. Skills such as working in a collaborative team environment, and effective task and people
                management are my focus since they are required to achieve this goal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, I know it sounds like a big dream, but as the saying goes, "If your dream doesn't scare you,
                it isn't big enough." I am determined to own a tech company within the timeframe mentioned above. This
                ambitious goal drives me to seek opportunities that will provide me with the experience and skills
                necessary to succeed. By working in a collaborative team environment and honing my abilities in
                effective task and people management, I am confident that I will be well-prepared to turn my vision into
                reality.
